The SportsPro Technical Support website is for the technical support department of SportsPro, a software development company that develops software for sports leagues. The purpose of the website is to track technical support services calls (referred to as incidents) in a database that also stores information about the company's customers, software products, and technicians. The web application supports two primary types of users. First, it lets administrators manage the products, technicians, customers, and incidents that are in the database. Second, it lets technicians update incidents that have been assigned to them.
